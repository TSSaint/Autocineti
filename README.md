# Autocineti
This is a web app built using JS/Angular that shows supercars and their stats, such as name, color, and price.

### Features to Add:
- More animations
- More cars
- Car single-view
- More pages
- Forum, comments, user interaction
- Change color scheme and add a more luxurious feel

### Note
This is a repository for starting on using the Angular.js framework!

A generalised pattern for creating an Angular app is:
<br>-Create a module, and use ng-app in the view to define the application scope.
<br>-Create a controller, and use ng-controller in the view to define the controller scope.
<br>-Add data to $scope in the controller so they can be displayed with expressions in the view.

### Review:
- A module contains the different components of an AngularJS app
- A controller manages the app's data
- An expression displays values on the page
- A filter formats the value of an expression

### On Directives:
Directives bind behavior to HTML elements. When the app runs, AngularJS walks through each HTML element looking for directives. When it finds one, AngularJS triggers that behavior (like attaching a scope or looping through an array).
